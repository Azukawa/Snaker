# Snaker
Flying 3d snakes.

Fun project to study 3d perspective and fixed timestep game logic.
Snakes fly around in an elliptical or helical pattern.
The initial movement patterns are determinical but a chaotic wobble varible consisting of three sines running on different rates is added to create an non repeating, natural looking movement.



N - to change style of snakes
Space - to pause snakes
